##### Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed the IMDb movie dataset and then communicate my findings. I used Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

This data set contains information
about 10,000 movies collected from
The Movie Database (TMDb),
including user ratings and revenue


#### Below are what I learnt after completing the project:

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
